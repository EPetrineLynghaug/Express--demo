# Express: A Minimalist Node.js Framework


## Description
Express is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides essential features like routing and middleware support in a Node.js environment.
In this project, we will set up a basic web server using vanilla Node.js, build a multi-page application, and implement some middleware to handle tasks like working with dates.


## Key Features of Express

Web workers are particularly helpful when dealing with tasks that are too heavy to run on the main thread

- **Simple Setup:** Express is easy to install and configure, making it a great choice for lightweight applications.
- **Middleware Support:** It offers support for middleware, allowing you to handle requests and responses more efficiently by layering different functionalities.
- **Routing:** Express simplifies the process of handling different HTTP routes (GET, POST, etc.) for building multi-page apps.
- **Large Ecosystem:** With a huge community and a wide range of plugins available, Express can be extended easily.
- **Non-blocking I/O:** Like Node.js itself, Express is non-blocking, meaning it handles requests asynchronously for better performance.
- **Built on Top of Node.js:** It leverages the power of Node.js without interfering with its core, providing a flexible environment for developers.

## Advantages of Express
  	1. **Ease of Setup:** It’s quick and simple to get started with, making it ideal for small and scalable projects alike.
	2. **Middleware Support:** The middleware system allows for better control over how requests are handled and processed.
	3. **Routing:** Express simplifies the handling of multiple routes in an organized manner.
	4. **Asynchronous Performance:** Non-blocking behavior ensures that the server can handle multiple requests efficiently.
	5. **Scalability:** It has a large and active ecosystem with many third-party modules that can easily be integrated.

## Disadvantages of Express

 1. No Built-in Features: Unlike some other frameworks, Express doesn’t come with a lot of features out of the box, which means you need to build or integrate them manually.
 2. No Built-in Database Support: Express doesn’t include a database system, so you need to manage databases separately, for instance, by using Node.js with a database like MongoDB,        MySQL, or PostgreSQL.

  ## In this project, we aim to:

	•	Set up a basic web server using Node.js.
	•	Build a multi-page application with various routes.
	•	Implement middleware to handle tasks like managing date information.

  ## Tech Stack

	•	Node.js: As the runtime environment.
	•	Express: For handling routing, middleware, and server-side logic.
