# 	Lecture Notes: Express: A Minimalist Node.js Framework.


## Description
Express is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides essential features like routing and middleware support in a Node.js environment.
In this project, we will set up a basic web server using vanilla Node.js, build a multi-page application, and implement some middleware to handle tasks like working with dates.

## Key Features of Web Workers

1. **No Built-in Features:** Unlike some other frameworks, Express doesn’t come with a lot of features out of the box, which means you need to build or integrate them manually.
2. **No Built-in Database Support:** : Express doesn’t include a database system, so you need to manage databases separately, for instance, by using Node.js with a database like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
